# Financial Inclusion in East Africa project
```

This project provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of financial inclusion across East African countries using data from the Finscope Financial Inclusion Surveys. Financial inclusion remains a critical challenge for economic development in the region. In countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, only a small percentage of adults have access to or use commercial banking services.

This project aims to analyze key indicators and identify patterns that can help predict which individuals are most likely to own a bank account, providing valuable insights for policymakers and organizations focused on bridging the financial access gap.

**Key Features**

- Data Cleaning & Validation: Ensures the dataset is accurate, structured, and ready for analysis.
- Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Examines relationships between key variables like bank account ownership, gender, age, household size, and location.
- Visualizations: A variety of charts and graphs, such as bar charts and scatter plots, to uncover trends.
- Correlation Analysis: Calculates Pearson coefficients to measure relationships between variables.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces the dimensionality of the data for more efficient analysis.
- Random Forest & Discriminant Analysis: Predicts bank account ownership using machine learning models.
- Key Insights: Highlights factors like gender, employment type, and rural vs. urban settings, which influence bank account ownership.

**Insights & Recommendations**
- Financial inclusion is still limited: A large portion of the population across East African countries lacks access to banking services.
- Gender disparities: Males are more likely to own bank accounts than females.
- Self-employed individuals: Tend to have higher bank account ownership.
- Rural vs. urban: There's a near-equal distribution of bank account ownership between rural and urban populations.

**Recommendations**
- Increase awareness campaigns for women on banking and financial services.
- Educate the rural population on the benefits and usage of financial services.
- Cross-country collaboration, especially between Uganda and Kenya, to improve financial service penetration.
